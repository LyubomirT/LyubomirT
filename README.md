# Hi there, I'm LyubomirT ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer (mostly), but also interested in desktop and frameworks. I like to create fun and useful projects using Python, Go, HTML, JS and other languages.

## ðŸš€ Some of my projects:

- [OrionBot](https://github.com/LyubomirT/OrionBot): A Python library that allows you to easily train and run chatbots using NLTK, while simplifying the process and not requiring a lot of knowledge of Machine Learning
- [LESP](https://github.com/LyubomirT/lesp): LESP is a lightweight, efficient spelling proofreader written in Python. It's designed to be easy to use and lightweight, while still providing a decent result when checking for spelling errors. Resource consumption is kept to a minimum, and the program is designed to be as fast as possible.
- [PrismBlue](https://github.com/LyubomirT/prismblue): PrismBlue is a neat little text editor that works quickly and doesn't consume much! Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and supports any file extension!
- [WinCuts](https://github.com/LyubomirT/wincuts): WinCuts is a Windows-native tool for easily setting up and managing custom keyboard shortcuts.
