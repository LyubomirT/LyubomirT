# Hi there, I'm LyubomirT ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer (mostly), but also interested in AI development and machine structures. I like to create fun and useful projects using Python, HTML, JS and other languages.

## ðŸš€ Some of my projects:

- [OrionBot](https://github.com/LyubomirT/OrionBot): A Python library that allows you to easily train and run chatbots
- [BingleMD](https://github.com/LyubomirT/bingle-md): A simple and neat markdown editor, with visual tools
- [MoveMe.js](https://github.com/LyubomirT/moveme.js): A lightweight JavaScript library for enabling Drag-and-Drop features to a HTML page without writing a lot of code

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:
