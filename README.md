# Hi there, I'm LyubomirT ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer (mostly), but also interested in desktop and frameworks. I like to create fun and useful projects using Python, Go, HTML, JS and other languages.

## ðŸš€ Some of my projects:

- [OrionBot](https://github.com/LyubomirT/OrionBot): A Python library that allows you to easily train and run chatbots using NLTK, while simplifying the process and not requiring a lot of knowledge of Machine Learning

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:

You can contact me on Discord (@lyubomirt), or using email: ternavski103@gmail.com

You can also join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4pfXVGfjXT), where I'm active the most!
