# Hi there, I'm LyubomirT ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer (mostly), but also interested in desktop and frameworks. I like to create fun and useful projects using Python, Go, HTML, JS and other languages.

## ðŸš€ Some of my projects:

- [OrionBot](https://github.com/LyubomirT/OrionBot): A Python library that allows you to easily train and run chatbots using NLTK, while simplifying the process and not requiring a lot of knowledge of Machine Learning
- [BingleMD](https://github.com/LyubomirT/bingle-md): A simple and neat markdown editor, with visual tools, and a "Fancy Pants" editor. Also supports split view, and has a HTML conversion option.
- [MoveMe.js](https://github.com/LyubomirT/moveme.js): A lightweight JavaScript library for enabling Drag-and-Drop features to a HTML page without writing a lot of code. Has no dependencies, and the page continues running smoothly!
- [AIDA](https://github.com/The-Orange-Squad/AIDA): AIDA (Artificial Intelligence Discord Assistant) is a Discord bot designed to provide conversational interactions with users. It uses the Cohere API for natural language processing and can be configured with different personalities to suit the tone of interactions.
